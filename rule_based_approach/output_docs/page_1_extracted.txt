File Number --------
It is expressly agreed that notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, the purchaser shall not be obligated to 
complete the purchase of the property described herein or to incur any penalty by forfeiture of earnest money deposits or 
otherwise unless the purchaser has been given in accordance with HUD/FHA or VA requirements a written statement by 
the Federal Housing Commissioner, Department of Veterans Affairs, or a Direct Endorsement lender setting forth the 
appraised value of the property of not less than $_128,000 
(sales price in Purchase Agreement). The 
purchaser shall have the privilege and option of proceeding with consummation of the contract without regard to the 
amount of the appraised valuation. The appraised valuation is arrived at to determine the maximum mortgage the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development will insure. HUD does not warrant the value nor the condition of the 
property. The purchaser should satisfy himself/herself that the price and condition of the property are acceptable.

Note: The dollar amount to be inserted in the amendatory clause is the sales price as stated in the contract. If the borrower 
and seller agree to adjust the sales price in response to an appraised value that is less than the sales price, a new amendatory 
clause is not required. However, the loan application package must include the original sales contract with the same price 
as shown on the amendatory clause, along with the revised or amended sales contract.
